Problem:

The main problem facing organ donation is the lack of trust and transparency in the system. Potential
donors are often hesitant to donate their organs due to concerns about how their organs will be used
and who will receive them. On the other hand, recipients are often uncertain about the origin and
quality of the organs they receive.

Solution:

The use of blockchain technology in organ donation involves the creation of a decentralized, secure,
and transparent ledger of all organ donations. This ledger would track the allocation of organs,
ensuring that they are allocated fairly and transparently.
Potential donors would be identified through a blockchain-based system that collects and shares
medical data. This would allow for a standardized approach to identifying potential donors, ensuring
that organs are allocated fairly.
